# TypeORM Overview

TypeORM is a powerful Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) library for TypeScript and JavaScript. It enables developers to interact with relational databases using an object-oriented approach. Here are some key features and reasons why developers choose TypeORM:

## Object-Relational Mapping (ORM)

TypeORM allows developers to work with databases using TypeScript or JavaScript classes, providing an abstraction over raw SQL queries. This promotes a more maintainable and understandable codebase.

## Cross-Platform Compatibility

TypeORM supports various SQL databases, including PostgreSQL, MySQL, MariaDB, SQLite, and Microsoft SQL Server. This allows for flexibility in choosing and switching between different databases.

## TypeScript Support

Being written in TypeScript, TypeORM provides strong support for the language, allowing developers to leverage static typing and other TypeScript features in their database interactions.

## Declarative Data Modeling

With TypeORM, you can define your database schema using TypeScript or JavaScript classes. This declarative approach simplifies the understanding and maintenance of your application's data model.

## Database Migrations

TypeORM supports database migrations, enabling version control for database schema changes. This is crucial for managing the evolution of the database structure over time.

## Query Builder and Repository Pattern

TypeORM includes a Query Builder for constructing complex queries and a Repository pattern for organized data access. This helps structure and manage database interactions in a more systematic way.

## Active Record Pattern

TypeORM supports the Active Record pattern, where database records are directly tied to model classes. This simplifies database operations and enhances code intuitiveness.

## Connection Pooling

TypeORM provides built-in support for connection pooling, enhancing the performance and scalability of database interactions in applications with a large number of concurrent users.

## Middleware and Plugins

TypeORM supports middleware and plugins, allowing developers to extend its functionality and integrate additional features seamlessly.

## Community and Documentation

TypeORM has an active community and comprehensive documentation, making it easier for developers to find support and resources when working with the library.
